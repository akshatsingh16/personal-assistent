    <p align="justify"> Designing Embedded Systems and the <b><u>Internet of Things (IoT)</u></b> with the ARM mbed offers an accessible guide to the
        development of ARM mbed and includes a range of topics on the subject from the basic to the advanced. ARM mbed is a
        platform and operating system based on <b><u>32-bit ARM Cortex-M</u></b> microcontrollers. This important resource puts the focus
        on ARM mbed NXP LPC1768 and FRDM-K64F evaluation boards. NXP LPC1768 has powerful features such as a fast
        microcontroller, various digital and analog I/Os, various serial communication interfaces and a very easy to use Web
        based compiler. It is one of the most popular kits that are used to study and create projects. FRDM-K64F is
        relatively new and largely compatible with NXP LPC1768 but with even more powerful features.

        This approachable text is an ideal guide that is divided into four sections; Getting Started with the ARM mbed,
        Covering the Basics, Advanced Topics and Case Studies. This getting started guide:<br>
        • Offers a clear introduction to the topic<br>
        • Contains a wealth of original and illustrative case studies<br>
        • Includes a practical guide to the development of projects with the ARM mbed platform<br>
        • Presents timelycoverage of how to develop IoT applications<br>
    <br></p>
    <p align="justify">
        Designing Embedded Systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) with the ARM mbed offers students and R&D engineers a
        resource for understanding the <b><u>ARM mbed NXP LPC1768</u></b> evaluation board.
